Let's calculate:

For ""running"":
sqrt((20.809742-5.3473587)²+(4.892649-(-8.7162))²+(9.523975-(-9.290831))²)
This gives approximately sqrt(240.49045448860932 + 185.68212961 + 352.722337865806) 
= sqrt(778.894922)

For ""walking"":
sqrt((8.892562-5.3473587)²+(3.6518903-(-8.7162))²+(1.6985638-(-9.290831))²)
This gives approximately sqrt(12.558614775009999 + 151.97844602400997 + 121.04545406564) 
= sqrt(285.582515)

Clearly the given embedding is closer to ""walking"", thus we classify it as ""walking""."
