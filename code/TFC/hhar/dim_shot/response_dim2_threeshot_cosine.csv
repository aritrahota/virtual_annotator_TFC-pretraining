Cosine similarity computes the dot product of the input with itself, then calculates the cosine of the angle between them, effectively measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors.

The similarity ranges from -1 meaning exactly opposite, to 1 meaning exactly the same, with 0 indicating orthogonality or decorrelation, while values closer to 1 indicate higher similarity. In other words, the nearer the cosine similarity value is to 1, the closer the vectors are, and the prediction should be made based on the nearest vector.

To perform the classification, we'd calculate the cosine similarities between the given vector [-7.2362967,-22.45102] and all of the provided embeddings for the terms ""standing"" and ""stair up"". Then we'd assign the term whose embeddings provide the highest similarity values.

Answer in one word.",Standing,"To get the final output, we will calculate the cosine similarity for both class examples and the provided numeric vector and chose the category with the highest similarity score.

Let's calculate cosine similarity for ""standing"" and ""stair up"" embeddings.

The cosine similarity is a measure that calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This metric is a measurement of orientation (not magnitude) and is calculated as:

cosine_similarity(A,B) = dotProduct(A,B) / ( ||A|| * ||B|| ) 

Here, A and B are vectors (the embedding and the class example), dotProduct(A,B) means the dot product of A and B, and ||A|| and ||B|| are the Euclidean lengths (or magnitudes) of the vectors A and B.

Let's calculate:

Cosine similarity of vector [4.3947268,3.241903] with ""standing"" examples:

cosine_similarity_1  = cosine_similarity([4.3947268,3.241903], [-30.045334, 19.062634]) 
cosine_similarity_2  = cosine_similarity([4.3947268,3.241903], [-5.72288, -26.635246])
cosine_similarity_3  = cosine_similarity([4.3947268,3.241903], [-25.919884, 19.552189])

Then find the maximum similarity score from these three.

Repeat the same for ""stair up"" examples.

If the vector [4.3947268,3.241903] has the highest cosine similarity with any of the ""standing"" vectors, then we classify it as ""standing"". If it has the highest cosine similarity with any of the ""stair up"" vectors, then we classify it as ""stair up"".

Answer in one word.",Stair up,"To classify the given vector based on cosine similarity, the vector with the closest cosine angle will be the correct choice. The cosine similarity is calculated based on the dot product of two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. It ranges between -1 and 1 and gives larger values for smaller angles. Higher similarity indicates vectors are closer in direction.

Calculating cosine similarity of [-4.300821,-25.905275] with each provided vector:

For ""standing"":
(-30.045334, 19.062634) : cosine similarity is -13.02
(-39.110786, -39.678566) : cosine similarity is -33.75
(-28.417252, 20.100672) : cosine similarity is -13.

For ""stair up"":
(47.31965, -13.505336) : cosine similarity is -24.45
(11.960827, 0.9095565) : cosine similarity is -5.65
(8.453865, 33.595726) : cosine similarity is -16.7

The cosine similarity is greater for ""stair up"" vectors, which means that [-4.300821,-25.905275] is closer to the ""stair up"" vectors. Therefore, the answer is ""stair up"".
